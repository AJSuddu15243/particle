# If you use any third-party libraries, you can add them here.
# For example, to add zlib (a common library), you could do:
# http_archive(
#     name = "zlib",
#     urls = ["https://zlib.net/zlib-1.2.13.tar.gz"],
#     strip_prefix = "zlib-1.2.13",
#     build_file_content = """
# cc_library(
#     name = "zlib",
#     srcs = glob(["*.c"]),
#     hdrs = glob(["*.h"]),
#     includes = ["."],
#     visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
# )
# """,
# )

# For now, this is all you need to start!
